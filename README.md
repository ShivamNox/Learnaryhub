> Adapt the list below to your actual stack.

- Frontend: React (or Vue / Angular)  
- Backend: Node.js + Express (or another framework)  
- Database: MongoDB (or PostgreSQL / MySQL)  
- Authentication: JWT / OAuth  
- Deployment: Render (on render.com)  
- Other libraries & tools: (e.g., Chart.js, Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap, Axios, etc.)

## Architecture

The application follows a standard clientâ€‘server model:

```

[ Browser / Frontend ] âŸ· [ REST API Backend ] âŸ· [ Database ]

````

- Frontend collects user input, renders pages
- Backend exposes API endpoints to fetch/update data
- Database persists user/courses/schedule/chat/AI logs

You may also integrate external services (YouTube API, AI/ML APIs, chat service) depending on your modules.
